      "description":"<h2>Background</h2><p>I enjoy bringing people together and rallying them around a common cause. While working at JWT, I built friendships that extend beyond crafting award-winning marketing campaigns by participating in nearly every extra-curricular activity at the agency. For example, the JWT TalentShow, I performed an original song on harmonica and acoustic guitar echoing the internal mantra of the agency: 'Worldmade.' After the talent show, I was approached by the head of PR to put together a band of colleagues for the heralded “Battle of the Ad Bands” competition that takes place annually during Agency Week. Naturally, I leapt at the idea and began canvassing musically talented friends at JWT. After some convincing, we assembled a group of musicians with diverse musical backgrounds. I sang backup and played keyboards for the first song, a rock rendition of Lady Gaga's “Bad Romance.” I sang lead vocals and played guitar for our second song, Billie Jean by Michael Jackson.</p><p>JWT placed first out of nine bands after a cheering crowd determined us the victor in a tiebreaker with Euro RSCG Worldwide. Aside from the enjoyment of bringing the company together for a fun event, winning was a strategic move from a business and PR perspective because it demonstrated that JWT is a hip, trendy, close-knit team of talented creators.</p>",
