Also, I assigned tasks to developers and made sure they had everything they needed to complete the tasks in a timely fashion by providing mentorship and direction when necessary.  This project was exceptionally challenging from a technical perspective because we had to recreate the image filter effects built into the camera inside the application on Facebook.</p><h2>Execution:</h2><p>CFM developed an app for Samsung that mimics the functionality of several features in their new cameras. These features include a robust-zoom, dual view and smart filters. Users began by either taking a photo from their webcam or uploading a photo from their Facebook page. The selected photo would then be displayed on the front of the camera. Users could then explore and navigate the cameraâ€™s features in real time. This included the ability to zoom in and out as well as adding dynamic filters. Once finished, users were encouraged to save and share the photo on Facebook, Twitter and via email. All the finished photos were saved inside a gallery within the app.",
