  "description":"<h2>My Contribution</h2><p>I acted as an independent contributor who took over the project from a string of developers who had clearly worked on the site over the course of several years.  The challenge was to get Magento and Wordpress to coexist seamlessly under a common look and feel.  After achieving this and launching the site, the client realized a spike in sales.</p><h2>The Execution:</h2><p>Clickfire redesigned an antequated shopping experience with a best in class responsive storefront.  ICU's mission is to provide independent designers with an interactive online platform to sell their work and grow their brands. Based out of New York, and with a strong connection to Paris, ICU offers a unique mix of European and America style through our product offering.</p>",
