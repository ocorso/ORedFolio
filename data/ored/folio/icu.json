  "description":"<h2>My Contribution</h2><p>I worked largely as an independent contributor on this project after taking it over from a string of developers who had worked on the site over several years. The challenge was to make sense of the garbled, fragmented code-base and ensure that Christan could have a responsive ecommerce site and a blog.  I implemented a solution, which enabled two different technologies, Magento and Wordpress, to coexist seamlessly under a common look and feel. After the launch of the site, the client realized a spike in sales.</p><h2>The Execution:</h2><p>ClickFire Media redesigned an antiquated shopping experience into a best in class responsive storefront. ICU's mission is to provide independent designers with an interactive online platform to sell their work and grow their brands. ICUâ€™s new site enables them to realize this mission.</p>",
