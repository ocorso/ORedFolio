      "description":"<h2>My Contribution:</h2>As a developer on the project, I researched methods of displaying video on a mobile device.  For example, I created several proof of concepts written in native code (Android/Java, iOS/Objective-C) that played video files both locally on the device as well as streaming off the internet while comparing and contrasting the performance of each.<h2>Challenge:</h2>ClickFire Media created a mobile app for GEICO. The app features Maxwell, GEICO’s signature piggy.</p><h2>Execution:</h2>Users begin by selecting their background as well as Maxwell’s signature pinwheel colors. To start spinning the pinwheel, users can blow into to mobile device’s camera. If you can make it spin fast enough, Maxwell will join the fun. Wheeeeee!!!!! Users can unlock bonus features by sharing the app with their friends on Facebook and Twitter.  Users can also learn more about GEICO, get a rate quote and download additional apps, including the Brostache and GECKO Ventriloquist app, which CFM built, through the GEICO apps setting.",
