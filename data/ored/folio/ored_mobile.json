  "description":"<h2>My Contribution:</h2><p>I participated in the content creation of the whitepaper by writing a technologist's perspective and then performed the front-end development of the landing page and html email blast that was sent to our mailing list of over 10,000 subscribers. Aside from the programming and copywriting, I also volunteered to be the face of ClickFire Mobile and am pictured in front of an array of mobile devices at the top of the whitepaper.</p><h2>The Whitepaper:</h2><p>As part of a marketing thought-leadership initiative, the team at Clickfire Media published a whitepaper explaining how the web has evolved to a point where the majority of users on the internet are consuming content on mobile devices rather than on a desktop. Several case studies help illustrate our capabilities as a vendor of digital production services.</p>",
