The 'Change Your Flavor, Change Your Life' flash execution, which was used to promote Stride SHIFT gum and subsequently the Stride SHIFT Concert Facebook tab, utilized a number of widgets built in HTML and integrated various 3rd party APIs including Foursquare and Youtube.</p><h2>Execution:</h2><p>ClickFire Media delivered a customized Facebook tab, ‘Change your flavor, Change your life.’ Over six weeks, a four-man team used Photoshop, FlexBuilder/Flash, Custom PHP and AfterEffects to create the application. Users are invited to watch a video and have the option to become one of four characters - Rodeo Clown, Ostrich Jockey, Adventure Traveler or Fortune Teller - by inserting a picture of themselves through file upload, Facebook album or webcam capture. Once the user customizes their photo, the images are placed in a photo album on their personal Facebook page and published to their news feed.</p>",
