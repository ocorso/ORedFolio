The user begins by selecting a background or uploading their own from their computer. They can select the car color, add car “wraps,” decals, window tints and wheels. Users also had the option to touch-up and/or paint their own patterns and decals too. After the user creates their car, they will be able to save their image to a gallery. Viewers can also browse through the gallery and rate the submitted customized cars. Each image is also fully shareable on Facebook, Twitter and email.</p>",
