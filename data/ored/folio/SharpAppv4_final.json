I managed the front-end development in Flash and performed the backend PHP programming. In addition, after assessing the technological needs of the application, I chose the web server/hosting provider best suited to the job (Rackspace Managed Hosting) and configured the Apache instance out of the box.</p><h2>Execution:</h2><p>ClickFireMedia was challenged by Sharp Electronics to create a Facebook application that showcased Sharpâ€™s home theater line, which includes their 60, 70, 80 and 90-inch AQUOS TVs.<p></p>To celebrate the start of football season, CFM developed a Facebook app that enabled consumers to create their ultimate tailgate experience. The app was integrated into a month-long Facebook contest. After customizing their tailgate with team colors, decorations, personalized pictures, and a half-time video, users submitted their creation and were eligible to win real-world prizes. Fans could win one of three big screen AQUOS LED TVs as well as all the goodies necessary to truly bring the ultimate tailgate experience to life. The app was fully shareable through Facebook, Twitter, and email, and fans were encouraged to get their friends to vote by liking their tailgate.</p>",
