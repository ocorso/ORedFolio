In addition, I managed and executed the creation of wireframes, sitemaps, and user flows to ensure the goals were met. As a tech lead, I oversaw the front-end development and assisted whenever road blocks were encountered.</p><h2>Execution:</h2><p>ClickFire Media was asked by our client, Translation, to create a completely new site for the McDonald's All American Games, which would act as a framework for all of the content dating back to 1977 and into the future.</p>",
