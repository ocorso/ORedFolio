Each day a new hashtag, based off Denny's and various food themes (#blueberries, #pancakes, #butter), was used for photo entries. Users were encouraged to submit their photos with the hashtag of the day via Instagram, or to upload them directly to the site. Each day a winning photo was selected, and that user received a $10 Denny's gift card.</p>",
