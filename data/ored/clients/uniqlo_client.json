  "description":"<h2>What We Did</h2><p>For the holiday season, Uniqlo wanted to create a giveaway engagement to live on their homepage that revolved around the animated GIF resurgence. They gave away the opportunity to win 100% off (up to $500), and everyone wins a coupon and GIF to share on Facebook, Twitter, and Email. Click was charged by Digitas and Uniqlo with developing the experience as well as creating close to 50 share-worthy animated GIFs. The HTML5 engagement runs seamlessly on desktops and mobile devices alike.</p>",
