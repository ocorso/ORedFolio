  "description":"<p>ClickFireMedia created custom QR Codes for DBA, and their client, Tiffany's. The QR Codes were displayed on cookies, using edible paper and ink. 16 Audrey Hepburn lookalikes handed out the QR code-frosted cookies in Times Square, Rockefeller Center, NYU and at the corner of 5th and 59th streets. The codes could be scanned to see an invitation for Tiffany&#x2019;s event that evening, at which the company unveiled a new jewelry line and host a performance by Leighton Meester.</p><p> ClickFireMedia designed a custom QR Code for DBA, and their client Tiffany &amp; Co, to be used at their launch event for 'What Makes Love True.' The QR Codes were displayed on photographs. Guests could scan the QR Codes, which would take them to the What Makes Love True microsite. CFM also set up analytics to track how many people scanned the code and accessed the microsite.</p>",
