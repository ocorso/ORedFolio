      "description":"<p>As a self-taught multi-instrumentalist, I play keyboard, drums, guitar, and sing.  Much of the music I perform is original songs. For over ten years, I have put together acoustic or full rock band projects and performed in the NY Metro area including historic venues such as The Bitter End, Kennyâ€™s Castaways and The Highline Ballroom.</p><p>The writing of lyrics and music is a creative process by which I am able to express emotional content and themes in a way that is both personally therapeutic and inspiring.  In addition, I enjoy the recording process and find that sound design is yet another way to engage my creativity.</p><p>Working with a band is a collaborative experience that borrows the team-building skills I have utilized my whole life playing organized sports.  In college, I formed Ocelot Red with some classmates who have since become life-long friends.  From 2005-2008, I put together another band, The Good News, that played monthly in New Jersey and NYC.  At present, I play with a rotating lineup under the name Red Machine.</p><p>Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the role music plays in my life is live performance.  Performing on stage is a rewarding form of creative communication because it allows for a personal connection to be made with the audience.  It is there that I am able to share each of my crafted works of art with the world.</p>",
