  "description":"<h2>My Contribution:</h2><p>A veteran of the agency world, I have worked at JWT, Big Spaceship, DG MediaMind, and 291 Digital.  I joined the Click family as a Lead Technologist to help strategically position the company at the forefront of the tech industry. I enjoy finding innovative solutions to the diverse challenges of our clients. I thrive on uncovering how things function and how to make them better. Fast, smart and creative with strong artistic sensibilities, I enjoy architecting digital campaign executions that require a multitude of interconnected technologies. I am equally comfortable diving deep into code or brainstorming creative ideas for a concept.</p><h2>The Company:</h2><p>In a constantly evolving landscape, ClickFire Media (CFM) is always one step ahead.  Click has all the tech tools along with amazing creative and technology talent under one roof. We create rich, innovative interactive experiences. Click 3X, CFMâ€™s specialized interactive team creates deep and rich digital campaign executions combining video, audio, VFX and CGI. We use ground-breaking technology and bend the rules of what's possible, creating entirely new realities in the form of brand experiences.</p>",
