  "description":"<h2>My Contribution:</h2><p>A veteran of the agency world, I joined the Click family to help strategically position the technology at the forefront finding innovative solutions to the diverse challenges of our clients.  I am all about uncovering how things function and how to make them better.  Fast, smart and creative with strong artistic sensibilities, I enjoy architecting digital campaign executions that require a multitude of interconnected technologies.  I am equally comfortable diving deep into code or brainstorming creative ideas for a concept.</p><h2>The Company:</h2><p>In a constantly evolving landscape, ClickFire Media puts all the tools along with amazing creative and technology talent under one roof to create rich, innovative interactive experiences - with an assist from Click 3X and their deep and rich resources in video, audio, VFX and CGI. We use ground-breaking technology.  We bend the rules of what's possible,  and we create entirely new realities in the form of brand experiences that stick to the roof of your brain.</p>",
