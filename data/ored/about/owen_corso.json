      "description":"<p>I am passionately driven to craft digital experiences in new and exciting ways.</p><p>I lead an original NYC rock band called The Red Machine and plays in various mens lacrosse leagues throughout the year as a take-away long stick midfielder.  A current resident of the East Village, Owen grew up in northern New Jersey, is the youngest of 4 boys and received a BS in Computer Science from Villanova University.</p><p>The dedication to climb out of tough times and reach towards success has been innately ingrained in me through the actions of my heroic mother.  She successfully raised four sons, alone, with very little money.  In doing so, she taught my brothers and I that goals are reached through hard work and determination.  The inspiration that springs from such a shining example of perseverance instilled in me a drive to make her proud and be the best person I can be.</p>",
