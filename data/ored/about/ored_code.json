      "description":"<p>I was educated in Computer Science at Villanova University. Since then, I have taught myself a wide variety of programming languages. I have special expertise in web programming languages such as PHP, ActionScript 3.0, HTML5, JavaScript, and MySQL. I find writing code rewarding because it is inherently logical, and at the same time intensely creative. There are always new and exciting chances to find new and better ways to create a product. Coding requires a 'learn instantly' approach to succeed, as technologies are constantly advancing.</p><p>I write code for Click 3X.  Part of my role is determining whether or not a particular creative idea is even technically possible using any and all available tools.  There has been a movement from creating the majority of our projects in Flash to creating responsive sites built upon web standards that can be viewed on all screens including mobile and tablet devices.</p><p>I write code on a freelance basis.  For example, Quick Spikes and Nick and Campbell are two e=commerce sites I built on a freelance basis for small startups.  I chose to use open source PHP platforms to power each of the sites; Wordpress and Zend Framework, largely because the incredibly extensive user base and open source community provided an invaluable resource during development.</p>",
