  "description":"by CHRISTAN on NOVEMBER 21, 2012 &#x00b7; in CREATIVES Last weekend I traveled over to Camaret-sur-Mer to visit my good friend and artist/designer Barbara Smith. Camaret is in Brittany, South West of Paris, situated in a small fisherman&#x2019;s village, away from city air and noise, looking over massive cliffs onto the Atlantic ocean &#x2013; its clean air, it&#x2019;s fresh air. We spent a lot of time chatting about work and Barbara&#x2019;s next exhibition which is to be announced for New York. And it never hurts to have a musician around to create a mood; Barbara&#x2019;s fianc&eacute; is Robin Foster, an absolute genius in music and composing, you should have a listen to his work here. So just a few photos of the visit and of course of Barbara&#x2019;s work.",
