 "description":"<p>As the Finalists of Roxy's Dare Yourself campaign are announced it's a good time to look back on how crowd sourced media as a whole, and those parts used in user-generated content in particular, have evolved over the past year.</p><p> Dare Yourself was launched allowing photo submissions via desktop upload, Facebook, and Instagram, the broadest base of options last year.  The options for video, however, were more limited.  Users could upload video their desktop or use YouTube, at the time the only real logical choice for pulling in user generated video. Obviously times have changed.  Options to submit video have expanded to include Vine, and even more recently, Instagram.  While it may remain a question whether those short-formats are right for the  brand, it can't be denied that the number of options video submission are starting to catch up to their still-image counterparts. </p><p>Looking forward to user generated contests in the future, with emerging tools like Vine and Instagram Video it is going to be interesting to see how brands integrate the latest and greatest tools in an effort to stay on-top of what social media their target demographics are most engaged with. </p><p>Written By Matt DeSimone on July 8, 2013.</p>",
