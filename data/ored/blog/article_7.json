  "description":"by CHRISTAN on OCTOBER 23, 2012 &#x00b7; in CREATIVES, NEWS &amp; PEOPLE My good friend and designer, Tania Petit, has moved to a brand new atelier at Metro Madeline in Paris. Her brand, NOOT has taken great strides over the past three years and now situated at Madeline, (those who have never visited Paris, Madeline is a beautiful part of the city and a great place for a designer to have her studio). Last week, I had a short visit at the new space before Tania and I went for lunch at a tiny Cambodian restaurant down the street. She never likes having her picture taken but I&#x2019;ll keep trying.",
