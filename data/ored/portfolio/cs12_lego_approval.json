      "description":"What this case study demonstrates: \nOur ability to create five animated shorts episodes specifically for the Web. \n\nBackground:\nLEGO reached out to us directly to create a series of short films for a\n marketing tie-in with the Pirates of the Caribbean movie launch with \nDisney.\n\nExecution:\nWe created five character-animated mini movies loosely based off of the \nPirates of the Caribbean movie, using characters and backgrounds made to\n look like they were made completely from LEGOs. The LEGO characters \nwere created using Maya animation software, and composited the VFX in \nFlame. \n\nResults:\nIn addition to planned distribution, all of the LEGO character animated shorts were featured in the Pirates of the Caribbean Blu-Ray DVD.",
