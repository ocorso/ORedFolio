      "description":"<h2>Challenge:</h2> ClickFireMedia was challenged by Big Fuel to make an animated holiday card generator Facebook app for their client, Children's Place. This app was part of a larger social media push to drive engagement on The Children's Place Facebook page, which currently has more than 1 million fans, this holiday season. <h2>Execution:</h2> CFM began the process by developing a create-your-own snowperson Facebook app. Users began the process by choosing one of five animated backgrounds. They can customize their snowperson by choosing arms, noses, eyes, clothing, and even props. They also have an option to name their snowperson as well as include a personalized, custom message. Once they finished their snowperson(s), they had the option to post it to their Facebook profile as well as send it to their friends on Facebook, Twitter and through email. The app was built in Flash. To further drive traffic and engagement on the Children's Place page, the app's launch was coordinated with a BigFuel/Children's Place promotion. The first 4,000 people to make a snowperson received a $5 gift certificate to Children's Place. <h2>Results:</h2> <p>Peak (launch day (11/16): 12,355 unique visitors </p> <p>30,843 Unique Visitors to date </p> <p>Average time on site: 4 minutes, 6 seconds </p><p>46% bounce rate</p> ",
