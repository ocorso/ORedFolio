      "description":"Alaska has some of the most dramatic seasonal temperature swings, the largest landmass of all the states in the union, and relatively, the least amount of police officers to oversee it.  With drama like that available, National Geographic Channel has just launched a show based on, and titled, Alaska State Troopers.  We worked with the National Geographic team from the beginning of the concept phases to make sure we didnâ€™t convey that this was just another COPS-style reality show.  After developing a variety of creative routes, we landed on a powerful and compelling music-driven promo that gave viewers a new perspective on life in the new frontier.  From there were dove headfirst into writing, designing, editing and finishing the on and off-air promos and toolkit, as well as a web-spot that drove viewers to the on-air and online presence of the show.",
