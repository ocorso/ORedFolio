      "description":"Just beneath the surface of our everyday existence lies a world weâ€™d hardly recognize and PBS turned to Click 3X to make sure that audiences knew where to discover it.  With the Fabric of the Cosmos, the centerpiece to PBS' November programming, Click 3X was given the opportunity to promote one of the most compelling, visual, fun, and comprehensive pictures of modern physics ever seen on television.  To promote the series, Click 3X created :30 and :20 promos, as well as toolkits that PBS could use to version bugs and endpages.  The promos illustrated the Big Bang in reverse, covering many of the main topics from the series in VO and 3D type, then watching as they each get sucked back into the creation of everything.",
