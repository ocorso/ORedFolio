Epix launched its Sports and Events division with Vitali Klitschko's heavyweight title fight against Odlanier Solis, giving boxing fans in the United States an opportunity to see a fight that might otherwise have been unavailable on television.  Tasked to create a three tier campaign for the event, our team began with a graphic-based teaser, continued on with live action promos, and completed the project with the live event graphics package, which included the fight open, insert package, and transitions.",
