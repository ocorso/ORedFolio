      "description":"How big of a deal is Lexus' all-new CT Hybrid? It was such a big deal that the legendary automakers launched the 45-video MSN.com Fresh Perspectives original series in late April as part of the launch campaign to introduce the new vehicle. Fresh Perspectives features six young artists - chef Craig Thornton, collage artist and painter Augustine Kofie, fashion designer Robert James, paper sculptor Jeff Nishinaka, singer-songwriter V, and photographer Tod Seelie - who create original pieces around three themes - escape, challenge, and empower - over a 24-hour period. The themes are inspired by the CT Hybrid, which challenges convention as the most fuel-efficient luxury hybrid available. Click 3X took the varied footage and stitched it into seamless narrative montages, capturing the essence of the diverse artistic talents with videos that are themselves supreme works of art.",
