            "description":"For the past few years, MTV has partnered with Click 3x on several projects that we term Interruption Advertising.  For each of these promos, we partner with MTV and prospective film studios, focusing on different elements of a new film that would be seamlessly integrated into an existing MTV promo, and ultimately shocking the viewer and drawing their attention to a trailer for the upcoming film.  The interruptions are hidden on air, and viewers need to keep a sharp eye to find them.  There is no one size that fits all, as some interruptions were created in 2D, others in 3D, and a few have even been shot in our space here at Click 3X. For our Splice integrations, we leveraged the look and feel of the technical devices from the film, and then the actual Dren (character from the movie) plays a role in the interruption from the promos for “The City.”",
