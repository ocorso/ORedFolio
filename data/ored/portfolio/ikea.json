      "description":"<h2>Background</h2><p>\nClick 3X worked with Ogilvy and IKEA to shoot and finish 16 instructional videos for IKEA's hardest to assemble and most return products. </p><h2>\n\nExecution:</h2><p>\nIn addition to shooting all the footage, we also edited, designed and built the numerous animations and  graphics. We also created the voiceover-less soundtrack, so they can be used across global markets. Each video averaged 8 minutes in length, and are prominently featured on the IKEA Youtube channel. All 16 videos were filmed in a single week on the Click 3X stage, using multiple cameras.</p>",
