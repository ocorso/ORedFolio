      "description":"Simon Blake, and Click 3X animator Justin Wolfson, working with a few of Simon's favorite creative partners, Ross Sutherland and Ken Yagoda, directed this fun spot for Maine Lottery.\n\nBlake said, \"The concept was to create a quirky, fun world based on currency graphics. I loved the idea of using physical 'scratching' as an animation technique like a flip book. The happy/sad faces were based on the right side-up and upside-down optical illustrations popular during the late 19th and early 20th century.\"",
