Welcome to a time where creativity and technology are within everyones reach and can change the world in a millisecond.  Welcome to the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nOur on-air image campaign for the 2012 MTV VMAs reflects this new ethos and embraces a world of transformative possibilities. Focusing on VMA talent to take us through this journey, we have created a :30 second image campaign that focused on what makes artists such as Pink, Taylor Swift, Alicia Keys, One Direction and Kanye West what they are.  With each individual spot, as we focus closely on the talent, visualizations deconstruct and reconstruct around them, as various different objects that represent core artistry, creative significance, animal spirit, as well as what the VMAs are all about - all the while changing and transforming to the beat of each artist's biggest, newest track.  And in a flash, it all sucks back and we find our stars on stage, tapping into these powers to transform into the artists that they are.\n\nTo achieve this, C3X teamed up with MTV Director Micah Perta and Creative Director Thomas Berger to board out the promo prior to the shoot, thus ensuring that we captured the proper essence.  Leading the charge for Click 3X was Creative Director Mark Szumski, Art Director Miguel Hernandez, and Editor Jeremy Baumann, who have overseen the VFX, design, and editorial components of the job, respectively.  Upon completion of the edit, animation and compositing was done both in After Effects and Flame to achieve the proper style and aesthetic.",

The LEGO characters were created using Maya animation software, and composited the VFX in Flame. \n\nIn addition to planned distribution, all of the LEGO character animated shorts were featured in the Pirates of the Caribbean Blu-Ray DVD.",
