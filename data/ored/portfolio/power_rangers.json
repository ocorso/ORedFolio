      "description":"Raise your hand if you never missed an episode of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers as a kid. Well, with a big effort from Click 3X, the coolest California teenagers in color-coded costumes are back in their 19th installment, this time on Nicktoons and based upon the Japanese Super Sentai Series. With Click 3x at the helm, the blue, red, yellow, green, pink and gold rangers explode onscreen, leaving fantastic trails of energy as they slice their arrays of weapons through the air. The final result combines high-octane action, martial arts and advanced special effects in promos and a promo toolkit package designed to show the Saban Brandsâ€™ live-action heroes in a whole new light.",
