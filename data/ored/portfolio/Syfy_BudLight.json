            "description":"The SyFy brand 'Imagine Greater' has become a unique staple with original idents and bumpers featuring their bold logo.  For the 'SyFy Summer of Imagination' Click3x created a unique bumper that stayed true to the SyFy brand but also incorporated their Bud Light sponsor into the summer of fun.  For this campaign, we were tasked with enhancing Bud Light's new 'Here We Go' slogan, which emphasizes the beer as THE brand to escalate good times, make them better, and bring people together.The project called for textured graphics that represent the summer in an original way, while still reflecting the SyFy brand.  To accomplish this, we created a 3D representation of the Bud Light bottle in SyFy's branded white space, then added the visuals representative of Bud Light's core brand attributes (cold, refreshing) to the walls within the space. The end result was a direction that froze the SyFy logo into cubes that chilled a refreshing Bud Light bottle and thus created rich story that conveyed Bud Light 's messaging.",
