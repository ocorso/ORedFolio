      "description":"Challenge:\nAs part of a Breast Cancer Awareness campaign, ClickFire Media was challenged by Digital Brand Architects (DBA) to build a Facebook application that raised awareness for breast cancer through illumination events and messages of hope and support.  \nExecution:\nThe BCA Facebook application page started with a welcome message explaining the campaign, followed with a few call-to-action buttons to take the user to main engagements of the application, which includes writing support/inspirational messages and participating in illumination events around the world. For the message section, CFM used the Google Maps API to display all the messages on a world map. Users can also share the map on their wall or with their Facebook friends, or through Twitter or email. The app was built entirely in HTML to maintain capability with tablets, computers and other mobile devices. \nResults: \n17,772 active users on the BCA Facebook Page\n5,000+ unique visitors have viewed the BCA facebook app \nMore than 3,000 messages sent during the week it launched. \nAverage time on the app: 1:08 minutes.",
