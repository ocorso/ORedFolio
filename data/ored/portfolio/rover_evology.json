      "description":"<h2>Challenge:</h2> \nTaxi challenged us to make a cutting edge and highly evolved site while pulling external content to promote \"the Puck,\" their new 4G pay-as-you-go mobile hot spot. Brand and product awareness for the Puck was aimed at men in their late teens/ early 20s and needed to reinforce the evology- evolution + technology- campaign.<h2> \n\nExecution: </h2>\nMarching into unchartered territory, CFM had to develop a new workflow to take the animations created in Maya and display them Flash 3D, creating the groundbreaking evology.com. Using programs ranging from Maya, Blender, Cinema 4D and FlexBuilder/ Flash to AfterEffects, Photoshop, Custom PHP, Flame and Protools, ClickFire developed everything: story boards, the shoot, editing and production of the video, plus all the interactivity.  The finished product demonstrated how ClickFire took a movie effects processes and applied them in new and inventive ways in the interactive space.",
