      "description":"Directed by Ders Hallgren, we worked with The Food Network to film a promo for the show, Cupcake Wars. The show is Cupcake Wars and for the promo campaign, Brian Hoffman brought an idea to us that would play off of the juxtaposition between the battle-ready title and the actual subject matter- cupcakes.  The result was a bunch of exploded cupcakes on the cutting room floor, few overly-sugared crew, and a super-slo-mo exploding cupcake resolve shot on Phantom at 1000fps.",
