      "description":"<h2>Challenge:</h2> \nClickFireMedia was challenged by GoodSkin Labs to create a custom blog tab on their Facebook page titled, “Read Between The Lines with Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank\" to give users insights and tips on using GSL products.<h2>\n\nExecution:</h2>\nCFM created a custom Facebook tab for their editorial content. We developed a custom theme and used Wordpress so the page would have a simple CMS. The tab supports videos, quotes, fun facts, and articles. The content includes a monthly video series with GoodSkin Labs’ endorsed dermatologist Dr. Frank, seasonal tips and new product news. All the content is viewed within the tab to keep users engaged on the GoodSkin Labs Facebook page.",
