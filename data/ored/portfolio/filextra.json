      "description":"Challenge: \nEstee Lauder’s Beauty Bank division challenged us to develop a digital campaign that would support the launch of GoodSkin Lab’s latest product, Filextra. The goal was threefold: To make consumers aware of a problem called mid-face sink, to introduce them to Filextra (the BeautyBank product that was created to help alleviate this problem), to get people to actually try the product and to have them share their experience with their peers.  \nExecution: \nThe campaign consisted of a viral video that lived on YouTube, and through humor and fun, delivered the messages about mid-face sink (the Problem) and Filextra (the Solution). A branded Facebook page was designed to house all of the campaign’s digital engagements, including the video, a quiz and an Ambassador Blog where our special panel of Filextra users shared their comments on the product.  \nThe video was also used in our outreach to the social communities where bloggers were also enlisted as brand ambassadors.",
