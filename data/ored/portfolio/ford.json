The driver gets to choose to the destination- Montreal, Vancouver or Toronto- and activity- eating, shopping, going to a show or hanging with friends- of their choice. Upon arrival, they are presented with a video to let them experience their destination. The richer media engages the user and promotes the new Fiesta.",
