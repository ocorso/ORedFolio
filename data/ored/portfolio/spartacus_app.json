      "description":"Challenge: \nClickFire Media was challenged to execute a unique iPad app for Starz based on its popular TV series Spartacus: Blood and Sand.\nExecution: \nCollaborating closely with Starz and with its strategic partner for app development, Brisk Mobile, ClickFire Media developed the concept, designed its graphics, and managed the entire production process. The free app is a script reader that allows users to read all 13 episodes of the series' first season. The scripts in the app are enhanced with show clips, audio and video extras, behind-the-scenes footage, and production stills that can be converted into iPad wallpaper. The app contains several unique features that combine elements of antiquity with modern life. Scaling Capua, for example, is an interactive widget detailing the social networks and back stories of the most fascinating citizens in Capua, the ancient city in which the series is set.",
