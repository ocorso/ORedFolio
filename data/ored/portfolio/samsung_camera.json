The app was designed to showcase features on the new line of Samsung Cameras. </p><h2>\n\nExecution:</h2><p> \nCFM developed an app,  which mimics the functionality of several features in the new cameras. These features included a robust-zoom, dual view and smart filters.  \nUsers began by either taking a photo from their webcam or uploading a photo from their Facebook page. The selected photo would then be displayed on the front of the camera. Users could then explore and navigate the cameraâ€™s features in real time. This included the ability to zoom in and out as well as adding dynamic filters. Once finished, users were encouraged to save and share the photo on Facebook, Twitter and via email. All the finished photos were saved inside a gallery within the app. \n\nResults: \n4,600 pageviews\n2,300+ unique visitors  \nAverage time spent in the app: 4+ mins.",
