      "description":"Click 3X is proud to present&#x2026;porn?  Now to be clear from the start, this is not (God help us) newly discovered, classic porn starring Dave Attell, but the comedian (along with some A-list pals), delivering commentary over those straight-from-the-room-with-the-swinging-door-in-the-corner-of-the-video-store flicks from the 70s and early 80s in his Showtime series, 'Dave's Old porn.' This not-to-be-missed Showtime series features plenty of swagger (and nudity) as Attell and friends' share hilarious commentary, as well as interview living porn legends as they share the raunchy behind-the-scenes scoop on their past erotic gems. For two seasons now we have worked closely with Dave Attel, doing everything from filming, to editing, designing, animating and handling audio for each 30-minute episode. Much of the work came in post, as the entire series is shot against a green screen, with the film, as well as over the top animated graphics, later added to the footage of Dave and his posse on the couch.",
