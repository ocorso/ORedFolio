      "description":"<h2>Challenge:</h2> \nClickFireMedia, in collaboration with internet professional services company Igicom and TIME Inc Content Solutions, created TIME Inc’s Mine magazine, a revolutionary product that harnesses the power of digital media to customize the magazine to each subscriber.<h2>\n\nExecution:</h2>\nCFM built the front end for the digital magazine, simplifying the navigation and adding animation of a belly band to streamline the publication’s look. CFM also took charge of the overall aesthetics, drawing up a neutral design that would accommodate TIME’s diverse roster of titles. \n\nIgicom built the interface and the back end for the magazine, including the fetching of the magazine’s content, the assembly into an online readable version, the customer contact pieces, as well as the interactivity of the ads. The end result was an online magazine identical to the print version, save for the hyperlinks.  \n\nTo receive his or her custom issue of Mine, the reader chooses from a number of existing TIME Inc publications and enters his or her preference onto the magazine’s website. After signing up, the reader receives an email with a link to the site that has the custom magazine and a digital reader. The preferences of the user are used to determine how the ads within the magazine are phrased.",
