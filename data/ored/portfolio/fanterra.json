      "description":"<h2>Challenge:</h2> \nThe vision of Fanterra started as a notion of what a perfect world would be if everyone had a better understanding of how to take care of our planet. Fanterra represented that world and the stories behind Fanterra would be told and shared through the eyes of six Fairies, each representing one aspect of the world: Earth, Water, Air, Fire, Forest, and Flowers.<h2>\nExecution:</h2> \nWe created this world and a user experience filled with magical discovery, information, memorable content, and fun share-able engagements. Our goal was to engage users as well as inspire them to share the message of Fanterra with their friends and in the end, share the knowledge of how together we can ensure a safer, healthier planet.",
