      "description":"Challenge:\nVICE challenged us to generate an interstitial consumer engagement to drive product awareness of the new Ford Fiesta.\n\nExecution:\nUsing FlexBuilder/ Flash, Cinema 4D, AfterEffects and Photoshop, CFM created an interactive overlay that gives users a drivers-eye view while exploring features of the Fiesta.  The driver gets to choose to the destination- Montreal, Vancouver or Toronto- and activity- eating, shopping, going to a show or hanging with friends- of their choice. Upon arrival, they are presented with a video to let them experience their destination. The richer media engages the user and promotes the new Fiesta.",
