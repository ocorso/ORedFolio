      "description":"Juan Delcan acted as Director, Design Lead and supervised post-production on this Herbal Essence spot showcasing the ability of the product to tame unruly hair. Tying in the product colors, the beginning of the piece was shot in hot red and orange colors to support the wilderness theme. In the second half, the spot transitions to cool, complimentary white and blue colors to emphasis the calming abilities. The piece also showcased product shots with after-effects created in post-production.",
