      "description":"<h2>Challenge:</h2> \nClickFire Media was challenged to create a promotional site for LG’s Netcast. <h2>\nExecution:</h2> \nThe promotional site introduces you to NetCast the way someone would enjoy it at home: Visitors to the site meet a friendly host seated on a comfortable couch, remote in hand. At your direction, the host flips through animated tiles on a carousel that represent NetCast partner brands, explaining each one. Each tile reveals a unique animation that transitions to an in-depth, animated experience of the brand’s offering, from Yahoo TV widgets to HD movies from Vudu.\nUpon expanding on the existing storyboards and concepts, ClickFire collaborated with Publicis Modem as well as Click 3X to handle everything, from film direction and 3-D modeling to animation and post-production. Everything is in-house and that made this complex project exceedingly smooth. Much like the site itself, everything the client wanted was in one powerful place.",
