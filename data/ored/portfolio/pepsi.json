      "description":"Challenge: \nIn this intriguing test piece,  Pepsi launched a campaign based around original characters called Wiwichus as a lead-up to the Holiday season (\"Wiwichu-a-Merry-Christmas!).  \nExecution: \nThe campaign launched in the Mexico market with these small Spanglish-speaking characters as the ambassadors. As a point of purchase promotion, consumers could trade in 5 bottle tops to receive a Wiwichu figurine.  The online portion of the campaign would give a more revealing look into the world of a Wiwichu- a world in which the characters live in floating bubbles.\nThe website allowed users to fall into this bubble world.  They were dropped into a seemingly boundless space with a variety of floating options.  They could meet the Wiwichus, download cool Wiwichu ringtones and wallpapers, as well as dive into each Wiwichu's world.\nThe complex build of the site was a true integrated project combining Away 3D, Adobe Flash and Flex, Maya and After Effects.  Each of the worlds were designed each to show the immersive character and personality of the Wiwichu, and then built in Maya 3D, and integrated into the Flash experience.  The user could move around in 3D space to learn more about the Wiwichu.  Each transition in  and out was driven by original sound design with bubble animations.",
