      "description":"Challenge:  \nThis project is an excellent example of how a tight integration with various contributors to a large site like can really work and be effective.  Click3X and MRM Worldwide collaborated to produce the web experience \"A World Like No Other\" for the US Army. \n\nExecution: \nClick3X created fully CG world including an army base, mountain/desert landscape, vehicles, and Army personnel. To create this world, Click3X worked with MRM and Smuggler, the producer of the live action component, to create a fictional base modeled after real Army bases in Kentucky and Colorado.  Each fly-through then transitioned into a live action segment.  It was critical that the part that Click 3X designed and built become part of a seamless and exciting whole. \nThe user experience begins with a flyover of the desert landscape and Army base. When the camera lands on an aerial view of the base, the user then has the ability to select different \"hot-spots\" which then initiate a camera fly over to that part of the base where the CGI transitions seamlessly to the live action webisodes.",
