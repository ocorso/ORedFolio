      "description":"Challenge:\nClickFire Media was challenged by BBDO to produce banner ads for their client, AT&T.  The banners featured the new AT&T HTC OneTM X phone.\n\nExecution:\nCFM built, animated and distributed seven rich-media banners. CFM began by doing a live-action shoot in our in-house studio. The shoot, compositing, edit, sound and development were all done in-house.\n \nIn total, there were seven rich-media banner concepts, which included broken glass, falling headphones, beatboxing, and dancers. All these banners showed the impressive sound quality for the new AT&T HTC OneTM X phone.",
