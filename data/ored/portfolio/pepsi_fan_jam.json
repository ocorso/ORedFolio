      "description":"For VH1's Pepsi Super Bowl Fan Jam, we created a show package that embraced the energy of fans at a sold out concert.  Our show open starts from the idea of a pulsing speaker that is front and centerstage, generating a metallic world of football helmets, guitars and microphones, and ultimately revealing a stadium full of fans.\n\nThe full show package consisted of mortises, lower thirds, a bug,\nbumps, transitions, background beds, package headers and a promo to\ntease the big event. C3X worked closely with VH1 to ensure that the\nintegrity of Pepsi, the Super Bowl and VH1's brands were met without\nsacrificing quality of content.",
