And to make sure that no one watches on an empty stomach, Syfy partnered with Hershey's to create an innovative and integrated brand opportunity for some of the most iconic candy on the market.For this project, Syfy, Hershey's, and Click3x teamed up on a series of Enhanced Billboards where four iconic Hershey brands interact within the white space of the Syfy logo.  These include a graveyard filled with Mounds and Almond Joy bars, as well as an exploding pumpkin that spills Reece's, York, and Almond Joy Pieces. For the project we created and modeled 3D representations of each candy (and package) within SyFy's branded white space, then added visuals representative of Syfy's 31 days of Halloween, such as cracked concrete, lightening flashes, and flickering lights to the walls within the space.",
