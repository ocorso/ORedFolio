      "description":"<h2>Challenge:</h2><p>\nClickFire Media was challenged to create an engaging interactive video and experience for GoodSkin Labs' new product, Equinol, to live on the their Facebook page.</p><h2>\n\nExecution:\n</h2><p>CFM produced the video from start to finish, beginning with a video shoot. The interactive experience features an (delete short) introductory video of GoodSkin Labs Global Brand Endorser Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank, followed by several clickable hot spots that allow people to learn more about dark spots and how Equinol can help. The hop spots featured a Zoom In tool to learn the difference between freckles and hot spots, and an Eraser tool to see the before and after effects of Equinol. Users can also take a quiz, watch an extended video from Dr. Frank as well as additional videos from GoodSkin Labs consumers, and click a purchasing call-to-action to Kohls.com. The interactive experience is featured in a custom Facebook tab on the GoodSkin Labs page.</p>",
