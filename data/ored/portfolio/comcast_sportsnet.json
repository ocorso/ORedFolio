      "description":"Comcast SportsNet (or CSN) is a group of regional sports networks in the United States with the rights to carry some or all of the local professional teams in baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer, as well as nightly sports-news and talk shows, and post-game shows.  Recently Click 3x was tasked with re-designing the on-air look for the network, which presented unique challenges and opportunities since the regional network is broad-reaching, covers a variety of areas of the country, and follows different sports and teams, all of which have a distinct, passionate following.  Our new look, seen throughout all game programs both in-studio and through the insert package utilized dynamic angles, super wide lenses and quick ratcheted camera moves to create the sense of a ‘CSN SportsNation’ brought to life.  Front and center to it all was a CSN branded 'chip' that lent a fresh, new identity to the network as well as created a place to house all kinds of information within the insert package, from logos to stats and in-game information.",
