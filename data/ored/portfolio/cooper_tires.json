      "description":"Challenge: \nClickFire Media was tasked by the Zimmerman Agency to develop two HTML microsites for their client, Cooper Tires. \n\nExecution: \nUsing the .NET CMS and Flash, CFM developed two microsites for the Discover A/T3 and Zeon RS3 tires. Each site had four separate sections, which essentially allowed you to follow the path of the tire from how it was made to where you could buy one. Both sites had an introductory video as well as several Flash graphics showing the tiresâ€™ details, which were designed by CFM. \n\nResults: \nBuilt two successful microsites for Cooper Tires' new marketing promotions.",
