      "description":"MTV & Wrigley turned to Click 3X for the 2nd year in a row to help create the month long 'Best New Artist' promo campaign.  Coming off of last year's successful run, Click 3x and Click 3x Creative Director/VFX Artist Theo Maniatis upped the ante and rolled out 4 promos that comprised a narrative arc that celebrated Wrigley React 5's new ice-fly campaign by showing its journey from creation through space and into Los Angeles for the awards show.  Created in CG and composited in flame, the entire story was initially spread out through 4 promos, and was then pieced together for a 45 second in-show segment that announced the winner.",
