Premium cable network EPIX is hoping to restore an old tradition, as well as make a name for itself as a future player in the boxing industry.  To do so, we launched a new image campaign that highlighted the fights that EPIX has aired in 2011 as well as shared the news of where to turn for the best and brightest in boxing's future.",
