The site must play the dual role of having an entertaining cultural presence, while offering access to product information.<h2> \nExecution:</h2> \nClickFire Media designed, shot, produced, and composited a 360-degree frozen-view of Danica Patrick's life with layers of visuals, hot-spots, and sound effects, detailing clock-stopping moments in the life of the Indy car superstar and Motorola in addition to 3D views of each Motorola device.",
