      "description":"This Herbal Essences TV Spot for Atelier was shot to highlight the natural elements of the product. Juan Delcan acted as Director, Design Lead, and supervised graphic design. Set pieces such as a waterfall, rain forest and shower were created in a studio to emphasize the water-activated capabilities of the product. The natural elements and ingredients of the product were filmed on set using water tanks and mirrors. It was followed up with postproduction editorial and motion graphics.",
