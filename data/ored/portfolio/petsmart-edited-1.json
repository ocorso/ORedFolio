      "description":"Challenge: \nClickFire Media was challenged by Bernstein Rein to give pet lovers the opportunity this holiday season to immortalize their furry family members in an animated family portrait that stylistically nods to the classic Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer holiday special. \n\nExecution: \nHoliday Pawtraits puts a contemporary twist on Rankin/Bass’ hybrid “Animagic” style by placing the card’s customizable, 3D-animated characters into handcrafted miniature model sets. Users can customize up to three pets and five family members and choose from three backgrounds to create their photo-real holiday scene. \n\nThe production took place over an intensive two-and-a-half-month period that started with meticulous storyboarding of all the character variations. There was no set process for compositing and matching 3D characters with filmed model scenes so CFM forged their own path, combining 3D and flash and compositing it back into video in Flash and rendered on the fly. Users can share their portraits via Facebook or email, rotate their scenes, activate mini-animations and hook up to Snapfish to order traditional photo prints.",
