      "description":"Challenge: \nIn celebration of the 33rd anniversary of the Little Tikes turtle sandbox, Little Tikes challenged ClickFire Media to create a fully aligned branded experience, which showcased their latest milestone as well as their recent partnership with the Sea Turtle Conservancy.\nExecution: \nCFM designed and developed a custom Facebook portal, which included two interactive sea turtle games and integrated ecommerce efforts through a branded Cafepress store. Fans can pick their own turtle and compete with their friends to get the highest score in the Go and Grow Turtle game. They can also help their turtle see the world in the Go N Grow Game. After gaming, fans can browse branded Cafepress store to buy branded sea turtle products, including CFM designed stickers, and donate to the Sea Turtle Conservancy all from the Little Tikes Facebook page. \nResults: \nRaised awareness and donations for the Sea Turtle Conservancy \nFeatured in Facebook Studio \nCreated the Click 3X Cartoon Band (sound effects)",
