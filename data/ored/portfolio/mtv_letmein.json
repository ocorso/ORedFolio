Sort of like a DJ that blends two songs together seamlessly, we took an existing MTV promo and integrated live-action footage that we shot into it through high-end visual effects, so that it could subtly play out a little longer and a bit more subversively than in the past.  The end result is a spooky and startling change of pace from our usual Integrated work, as well as an incredibly memorable performance by Trevor King, Click 3x's Head of Sales, in the role of Garbage Bag Man.",
