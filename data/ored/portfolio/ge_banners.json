      "description":"<h2>Challenge:</h2> \nClickFire Media was tasked with developing a series of flash banner ad takeovers for BBDO and their client, GE Appliances. <h2>\n\nExecution:</h2> \nCFMâ€™s first task was to organize a full two-day stop-motion food shoot, including bringing in several professional food stylists. We produced seven unique rich media banner ads, using the stop-motion footage from our in-house studio shoot. These ads visually showed how the battle for finding space in the refrigerator was over once you had a GE refrigerator. Each ad consisted of food flying around and fitting nicely into a full GE refrigerator. All the ads were created using a combination of Photoshop, After Effects and Flash. \n\nResults: \nSuccessfully organized a full two-day stop-motion food shoot\nCreated and executed the banners on time and within budget.",
