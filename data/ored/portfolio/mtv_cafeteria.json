      "description":"Click 3x and MTV recently teamed up on the editorial and animation for the latest PSAs for MTV's multi-year initiative called \"A Thin Line,\" which is aimed at stopping the spread of abuse in the form of sexting, cyberbullying and digital dating abuse. The goal of the initiative is to empower America's youth to identify, respond to and stop the spread of the various forms of digital harassment. 'A Thin Line' addresses digital abuse issues on a number of fronts, including on-air, online and with real-world initiatives integrated into MTV's top-rated programming.\n\nThese latest spots exist in two worlds, where an action that occurs within the walls of a school is actually a visual representation of the cyber world.  Each spot then culminates in a final scene where the main character sits in front of his/her computer creating or experiencing the types of digital abuse that we are warning against.",
