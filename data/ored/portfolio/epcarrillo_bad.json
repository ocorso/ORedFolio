Carrillo to create a site using the Twitter and Google Maps APIs. \nExecution: \nTo create the site's functionality, the team at ClickFire accessed the APIs of Twitter and Google Maps. While a community of developers has sprung up around Google Maps API, this particular solution scrapes live tweets, selects for the keyword \"cigar\" from all Twitter feeds 150 times an hour (the maximum number of requests allowed), then verifies each user's location and filters the messages for relevance. Every five seconds, it publishes a new tweet on a 2D global map, time-stamped GMT.","title":"EP Carrillo","assets":[{"id":"1","description":"","filename":"epcarrillo","title":"","media_type":"1"}]}}
