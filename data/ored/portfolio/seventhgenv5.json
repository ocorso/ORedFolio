Then, they were encouraged to upload a photo, either through Facebook or their computer, to display with their message. Each of the messages were randomly displayed in interactive mosaic. Each week, there were also weekly giveaways based on users’ submissions. \nResults: \nProduced and executive a Facebook app on time and on budget \n1,800+ active users in the first week.",
