      "description":"Background\nClick 3X worked with Ogilvy and IKEA to shoot and finish 16 instructional videos for IKEA's hardest to assemble and most return products. \n\nExecution:\nIn addition to shooting all the footage, we also edited, designed and built the numerous animations and  graphics. We also created the voiceover-less soundtrack, so they can be used across global markets. Each video averaged 8 minutes in length, and are prominently featured on the IKEA Youtube channel. All 16 videos were filmed in a single week on the Click 3X stage, using multiple cameras.",
