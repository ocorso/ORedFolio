Each day a new hashtag, based off Denny's and various food themes (#blueberries, #pancakes, #butter), was used for photo entries.  Users were encouraged to submit their photos with the correct hashtag of the day via Instagram, or upload them directly to the site.  Each day a winning photo is selected, and that user is given a $10 Denny's gift card.",
