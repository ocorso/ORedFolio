      "description":"<h2>Challenge:</h2>\nClickFire Media was challenged by The Martin Agency to create an in-game banner ad for their client, Walmart. <h2> \n\nExecution</h2>\nCFM created an interactive fishing-themed banner ad game, called Fish Follow. The game begins when a user clicks on the rich-media expandable ad. Users are instructed to center their \"lure\" over the target to try and catch as many fish as possible. Once they finish playing, they are directed to another screen with their game stats as well as a selection of fishing rods, reels and other accessories with a direct link to buy on Walmart.com. The game was created using 3D rendering and Flash.",
