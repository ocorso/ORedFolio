The interactive video features key points from GoodSkin Labs experts, including Global Brand Endorser Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank as well as several clickable segments that allow people to learn more about enlarged pores and how Z-Pore can help. At the end of the interactive video, users can also take a quiz, watch additional videos from GoodSkin Labs consumers as well as a Kohls.com purchasing call-to-action. The interactive video is featured in a custom Facebook tab on the GoodSkin Labs page.</p>",
