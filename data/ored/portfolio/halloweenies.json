Party City's agency of record Zimmerman challenged ClickFireMedia to create an online haunted house populated entirely by animated hot dogs in costume.</p><h2>Execution:</h2><p>The resulting website brings together 3D animated characters, Facebook Connect, interactivity, viral video, and a link to buy the real costumes from Party City.
