      "description":"This fall, PBS and Click 3X teamed up to excite the masses about PBS' first ever PBS Arts Fall Festival.  A centerpiece of this fall's PBS calendar is the first-ever PBS Arts Fall Festival, offering full-length performances, artist and performer profiles, behind-the-scenes documentaries and mini-films about the art scenes in Miami, San Francisco, Cleveland, Chicago, the Blue Ridge Mountains and other areas of the country.  Beginning in June and working through the summer, Click 3x worked with the PBS team to first sell through the project with an internal sizzle, then expanded upon their own work with a long lead tease and series of promos.  Using powerful graphics and star studded footage to illustrate how our festival embraces the entire nation, Click's work travelled from coast to coast, and highlighted a variety of the network's biggest events.",
