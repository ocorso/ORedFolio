      "description":"Who says cheerleading isn't a real sport? Definitely not Click3X. CMT and Click3X teamed up again to produce the show package for CMT's new hit reality series CHEER. Starting at the base, we conceptualized and designed the full show package and CMTdecided on a full live-action shoot for their show open. Our head creative director, Ders Hallgren, shot our cheerleaders using a phantom camera at 400 frames per second over a seamless background. In post production, our team of creatives then edited, animated, and composited all components for the show graphics and open. Tumbles, pyramids, and highly dramatic stunts, we were able to show what cheerleaders really representâ€¦.pure, dedicated athletes.",
