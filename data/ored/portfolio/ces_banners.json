      "description":"<h2>Challenge:</h2>\nClickFire Media created banners for BBDO and their client, AT&T which ran on Engadget.com during the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show.\n\n<h2>Execution:</h2>\nUsing Flash, CFM developed a banner ad, which showcased a different top-notch mobile developer for each day of the Consumer Electronics Show. A micro-site, which was compatible with desktop computers and mobile devices, was developed that allowed applicants wishing to be featured in the banner and site to apply. All the micro-site submissions were then automatically sent to a CMS, which was custom built by CFM to manage the campaign. This CMS served as a submission review tool for the submitted content as well as a control panel to swap out the featured developer and manage the previous winners gallery on the banner and micro-site.",
