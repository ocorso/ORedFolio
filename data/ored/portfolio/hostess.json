      "description":"<h2>Challenge:</h2> <p>ClickFireMedia was challenged by Bernstein Rein to produce a Facebook application with several interactive videos, for their client, Hostess.  This theme of the Facebook app was to encourage Twinkie and Hostess Cupcake lovers to celebrate the small milestones or celebrations in our day to day lives.</p><h2>Execution:</h2><p>CFM worked with College Humor director/DP team Josh Ruben and Vincent Peone to film six videos during one full day shoot. Hostess fans could go to the app, and write their latest accomplishments. Using the Facebook API, ClickFire Media pulled profile and friends images as well as the users' customized text. These assets were then match moved so that they were seamlessly integrated into the videos.  The end result was impressive, giving the appearance that the video was custom shot for the user.</p>",
