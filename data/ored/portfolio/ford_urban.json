      "description":"<h2>Challenge: </h2>ClickFire Media was challenged by UniWorld Group to  redesign the site to show Ford’s support of major community events, like the three-day Essence Music Festival in New Orleans. <h2>Execution: </h2>ClickFire designed the new site from the ground up, from wireframes to 3-D effects. While community is the main focus of the redesign, the site is also designed to invite visitors to explore the cars targeted to their demographic.The site also features video and photos from Ford’s road-trip tour of historically black colleges and universities. Video interviews with drivers, students, and contest winners add to the site’s energy and feeling of community. The second phase of the site featured a mobile WAP site, a photo gallery, and a lot more video, a strength of ClickFire's sister company, Click 3X. <h2>Results: </h2> Successfully executed a website and mobile site redesign Significantly increased consumer engagements levels and time on the site through videos, photo galleries, and an interactive test drive experience",
