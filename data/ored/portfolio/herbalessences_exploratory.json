      "description":"Atelier reached out to Juan Delcan to shoot an exploratory video for Herbal Essences to showcase hair in various elements. Juan acted as Director and Creative Lead. The shoot utilized experimental elements such as water tanks, mirrors, projectors, and glass pieces shot with a phantom camera. Using natural props such as flowers and plants as well as adding after effects and motion graphics, three themes were developed to highlight the product attributes.",
