Users are invited to watch a video and have the option to become one of four scenarios, Rodeo Clown, Ostrich Jockey, Adventure Traveler or Fortune Teller, by inserting a picture of themselves through file upload, Facebook album or webcam capture. Once the user customized their photo, the images were placed in a photo album on their personal Facebook page and published to their news feed.",
