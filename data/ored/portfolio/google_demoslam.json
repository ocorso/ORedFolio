      "description":"<h2>Challenge: </h2>\nClickFireMedia was tasked to create a series of interactive Google ads for Johannes Leonardo, and their client, Google.<h2> \nExecution: </h2>\nDemo Slam is a google contest in which they put up two different videos that feature google technologies and the viewers then get to vote on which video they prefer. Each banner features different videos in them that have battles, so the content we put in the banners is specific to that battle of the week. Working with Johannes Leonardo, ClickFire Media produced more than two dozen separate banners and those banners were both rich media and standard banners. The banners are highly engaging, including tandem banners in which you see the demo video jump from one banner to the next in order to the battle.",
